# Indentation is used to indicate a block of code

# This code would run...
if 5 > 2:
    print("5 is greater than 2.")

# but this code would not.
if 5 > 2:
print("5 is greater than 2.")

# The number of spaces has to be the same for each block of code.
if 5 > 2:
    print("5 is greater than 2...")
print("which means that 2 is smaller than 5.")
